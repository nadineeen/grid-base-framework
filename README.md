# grid-base-framework
Custom 12 grid-base framework

## Responsive Columns
This framework comes with two different columns:
- ```.col-{n}``` where 1 < n < 12 which determines how many 'cells' a column should span regardless of the screen width
- ```.col-{breakpoint}-{n}``` where the column's width is 100% until the specified breakpoint

The breakpoint values are as follows:

| Breakpoint    | Size          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| s     | 600px |
| m      | 768px     |
| l | 1024px      |
